        ANALYSIS OF CATEGORICAL DATA USING R SOFTWARE

        <span class="brief">Brief Intro:</span>
        <p class="one">
          A workshop on the "Analysis of Categorical Data with R" would be a
          valuable investment for any business or organization looking to
          improve their data analysis capabilities. Categorical data is a type
          of data that is divided into groups or categories rather than being
          measured on a continuous scale, and it is commonly found in many areas
          of business, including marketing, finance, and operations.
        </p>
        <p class="one">
          By learning how to analyze categorical data with R, participants in
          the workshop would gain a powerful tool for making data-driven
          decisions and improving business performance. R is a widely used
          statistical software program that provides a flexible and
          comprehensive framework for analyzing data, and it is particularly
          well-suited for handling categorical data.
        </p>
        <p class="one">
          During the workshop, participants would learn how to use R to analyze
          categorical data, including techniques such as contingency tables,
          chi-square tests, and logistic regression. They would also learn how
          to visualize and interpret their results, enabling them to communicate
          their findings effectively to stakeholders across the organization.
        </p>

        <p class="one">
          By investing in a workshop on the analysis of categorical data with R,
          businesses and organizations can improve their data analysis
          capabilities, gain valuable insights into their operations, and make
          more informed decisions. Additionally, the skills and knowledge gained
          from the workshop can be applied across a wide range of business
          domains, providing long-term value and return on investment.
        </p>
        <p class="one">
          Categorical data are by no means restricted to the social and
          biomedical sciences. These sets of data also frequently occur in the
          behavioral sciences (e.g., type of mental illness, with the categories
          schizophrenia, depression, neurosis), epidemiology and public health
          (e.g., contraceptive method at last sexual intercourse, with the
          categories none, condom, pill, IUD, other), genetics (type of allele
          inherited by an offspring), botany and zoology (e.g., whether or not a
          particular organism is observed in a sampled quadrat), education
          (e.g., whether a student response to an exam question is correct or
          incorrect), and marketing (e.g., cons preference among the three
          leading brands of a product). These datasets even occur in highly
          quantitative fields such as engineering sciences and industrial
          quality control. Examples are the classification of items according to
          whether they conform to certain standards, and subjective evaluation
          of some characteristic: how soft to the touch a certain fabric is, how
          good a particular food product tastes, or how easy a worker finds it
          to perform a certain task. Categorical variables are of many types. In
          this workshop we shall provide ways of classifying them and analyzing
          relevant real-life datasets with R software. The two-day physical
          workshop will showcase many ways of writing R commands to solve
          problems that are categorical in nature.
